Summary of Application:
- using React components and Redux state, we use a form to take user inputs in order to draw lines onto the canvas
- we use the user inputs and create a list of lines that can be viewed within the application
- clicking on said line will for now select that specific line and show a delete button to delete it from the list

Goals:
- allow for the application inputs to register the values of the "selected line"
- re-render the map for every instance that the array of lines changes
- allow for more user inputs in order to customize the lines
